Introduction to DataSet
----------------------------

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a standard therapy for children with a variety of both malignant (i.a. acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia) and nonmalignant diseases (i.a. severe aplastic anemia, Fanconi anemia). It is of significant importance to find matched donor such that ensure success outcome and reduce the risk of complications like graft-versus-host disease after transplantation procedure. In gereral, Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) Matching is conducted to find out if hematopoietic stem cells match between the donor and the patient receiving the transplant. However, due to the difficulty and time consuming to find a fully matched donor, it is acceptable to use unrelated donors mismatched at 1-2 HLA alleles. Previous research also proposed that increased dosage of CD34+ cells / kg extends overall survival time without simultaneous occurrence of undesirable events affecting patients' quality of life (KawÅ‚ak et al., 2010).

This data set describes pediatric patients with several hematologic diseases grouped into malignant disorders and nonmalignant. All patients were subject to the unmanipulated allogeneic unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A total of 187 patients are included in this data set. And 39 attributes about donor and recipient’s matching properties and their survival outcomes after transplantation are recorded

The data is worth investigating as it is well organized and recorded many detailed information about both donor and recipient before and after transplantation procedure. Here are some of the motivations and potential methods to analyze the data set. 
1.	Identify the most important factors influencing the success or failure of the transplantation procedure through univariate logistic regression model.
2.	Build effective model for survival prediction after stem cell transplantation. Multivariate logistic regression model or machine-learning method can be utilized.
3.	Using survival time as outcome, survival analysis can also be conducted to investigate the effect of matching factors on patient status after implantation procedure.
